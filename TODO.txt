Important:

fix balance holdings cache / dynamic view (array of new values) to be called after for example GetStake()

1. Multisig stuff

2. change link like "http://localhost:7072/tx/{{Hash}}" to a dynamic one based on network selected (ie either http://localhost:7072/tx/{{Hash}} or https://explorer.phantasma.io/tx/{{Hash}} for example) in context

3. write documentation


Wait for new ABI:

1. TokenInfo as contract parameter does not work yet --> new ABI will describe complex types, until then an Object can only be an Address.

2. Check when/if call require signed tx


For later:

1. i want to be able to go through like /send/P14ZWsVcCckk9jGS74ici57Vp6F5fZGLVMiKJmdFYnF88 and that gets me to the send screen with the address prefilled

2. account type login (db + logic + view)

3. Account import/export/swap
