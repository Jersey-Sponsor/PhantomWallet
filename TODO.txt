i want to be able to go through like /send/P14ZWsVcCckk9jGS74ici57Vp6F5fZGLVMiKJmdFYnF88 and that gets me to the send screen with the address prefilled

Network type + currency + dark mode saved locally / xml?

api number returned, divide by decimals (10 or 8)

change link like "http://localhost:7072/tx/{{Hash}}" to a dynamic one based on network selected (ie either http://localhost:7072/tx/{{Hash}} or https://explorer.phantasma.io/tx/{{Hash}} for example)










TokenInfo as contract parameter does not work yet
same for ArchiveFlags  and ExchangeOrderSide
