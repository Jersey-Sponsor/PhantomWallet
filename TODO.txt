1. Multisig stuff

2. i want to be able to go through like /send/P14ZWsVcCckk9jGS74ici57Vp6F5fZGLVMiKJmdFYnF88 and that gets me to the send screen with the address prefilled

3. TokenInfo as contract parameter does not work yet --> new ABI will describe complex types, until then an Object can only be an Address.

4. config file path win + *nix

5. add logfile 

6. change link like "http://localhost:7072/tx/{{Hash}}" to a dynamic one based on network selected (ie either http://localhost:7072/tx/{{Hash}} or https://explorer.phantasma.io/tx/{{Hash}} for example)

7. account type login
