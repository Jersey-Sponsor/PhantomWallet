1. Network type + currency + dark mode saved locally / xml? --> done

2. api number returned, divide by decimals (10 or 8) --> needs to be done on the frontend

3. Multisig stuff

4. i want to be able to go through like /send/P14ZWsVcCckk9jGS74ici57Vp6F5fZGLVMiKJmdFYnF88 and that gets me to the send screen with the address prefilled

5. TokenInfo as contract parameter does not work yet --> new ABI will describe complex types, until then an Object can only be an Address.
