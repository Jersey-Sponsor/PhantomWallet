1. GetAbi / bug when passing chain and contract

generic contract call: nothing returned for example for energy / getunclaimed

2. i want to be able to go through like /send/P14ZWsVcCckk9jGS74ici57Vp6F5fZGLVMiKJmdFYnF88 and that gets me to the send screen with the address prefilled

3. getToken/getStakes

4. getTokenBalance

5. remove hardcoded chain

6. Simnet / MainNet / TestNet
